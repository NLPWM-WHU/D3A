nevertheless the food itself is pretty good .
my suggestion is to eat family style because you 'll want to try the other dishes .
great food at reasonable prices , makes for an evening that ca n't be beat !
look foward to trying the ruben upon returning .
we usually go to the chart house to celebrate a birthday or anniversary .
this little place has a cute interior decor and affordable city prices .
the price is reasonable although the service is poor .
i have been to roth 's twice and both times were very disappointing .
three courses , choices include excellent mussels , puff pastry goat cheese and salad with a delicious dressing , and a hanger steak au poivre that is out of this world .
the wine list is excellent .
they would n't even let me finish my glass of wine before offering another .
this is a consistently great place to dine for lunch or dinner .
i grew up eating dosa and have yet to find a place in ny to satisfy my taste buds .
with the great variety on the menu , i eat here often and never get bored .
the menu is limited but almost all of the dishes are excellent .
great bagels , spreads and a good place to hang out in .
the cuisine from what i 've gathered is authentic taiwanese , though its very different from what i 've been accustomed to in taipei .
all my co-workers were amazed at how small the dish was .
the wait staff is friendly , and the food has gotten better and better !
this place is so much fun .
i was glad i did .
i 'll be back soon .
went inside and i started to get excited .
we have been to montparnasse many times and return often for good reason .
it 's somewhere you can eat and be happy .
some baby pizzas get their wish .
the lava cake dessert was incredible and i recommend it .
the last time i went we were seated at a table in a corridor next to the kitchen .
good selection of wines ranging from affordable to high end .
the entire dining experience was wonderful !
service is highly refined , our seating was delayed 35 minutes past our reservation and the maitre d apologized and regularly kept us apprised of progress .
order the panang duck , it 's fantastic .
for great chinese food nearby , you have wu liang ye and grand sichuan just a block away .
but who says murray 's is anything about service .
i have never been disappointed in the red eye .
its an excellent place to relax and the food is one of the best in the city of new york .
first off , the waitress was completely unattentive the 2 times we saw herodd in a restaurant with 6 tables and got our order wrong .
the food was bland oily .
i went there in late afternoon for some bite size food and refleshment with my date .
went with mommy the only person who could afford taking me here .
i am completely hooked on this place , it is ridiculous .
have recommended the place to friends , always gets good response .
i love the atmorphere @ peep !
it 's a rather cramped and busy restaurant and it closes early .
they were served warm and had a soft fluffy interior .
frankly , when you compare what you can have here for lunch , versus mcds or so many other sandwich shops in the city , there is no comparison .
a narrow corridor leads to a tiny space where there are three tiny white tiled counters , a great deal of mess stacks of bottles , cans and a small counter holding 12-14 entrees .
succulent steaks cooked precisely to your desired doneness accompanied by salads and sides that do n't look like leafy road kill .
this dish is my favorite and i always get it when i go there and never get tired of it .
i also ordered the change mojito , which was out of this world .
the anti-pasta was excellent , especially the calamari , as were the filling pasta mains .
the waitress suggested glasses of wine that went very well with the food .
they might be all business at the counter when you give your order , but their food says i love you .
do n't go there !
amma has the worst value for money i have experienced in nyc over the past 2 years .
i think this would be a pretty good spot if it were not so overpriced and overrated .
the have over 100 different beers to offer thier guest so that made my husband very happy and the food was delicious , if i must recommend a dish it must be the pumkin tortelini .
you must have the crabmeat lasagna which is out of this world and the chocolate bread pudding for dessert .
open late well as late as i ever got there and i 'm a night person
we were still sitting at the bar while we drank the sangria , but facing away from the bar when we turned back around , the $ 2 was gone the people next to us said the bar took it .
this place is great .
this has got to be one of the most overrated restaurants in brooklyn .
at first i was slightly skeptical because it was a sushi restaurant in the middle of nyc .
it 's really also the service , is good and the waiters are friendly .
and it was quick which is very important .
joya used to be a cool spot with decent food and a colorful , if not relaxed , atmosphere .
the food was really good , i had the onion soup and it was one of the best ever .
i will have to say , this bengali fast food joint is clearly my favorite .
i 'm not picky , but it was actually gross .
overall , a solid restaurant and at less than $ 40pp including wine , a solid deal as well .
since it literally is a complete hole in the wall , it 's a bit intimidating at first , but you get over that very quickly as soon as the friendly staff welcomes you , do n't hesitate to ask for help with what to get .
when he finally did , he was unable to make a gin and tonic - could n't find tonic .
we will go back every time we are in the city .
i have to agree with the previous reviewer .
if you were there when it first opened , give this restaurant a second chance .
definitely a great spot for a nice occasion or date .
not pretentious and very economical .
fresh ingredients and everything is made to order .
they are tasty , but i suggest only eating one with meat because they tend not to mesh that well with the average american digestive system .
the noise level was unbearable , conversation impossible .
one of the earlier people commenting on the restaurant did not get the that some experimenting is going on with the menu in a positive way .
thanks bloom 's for a lovely trip .
odd for ave b , not just odd , the place attracts an eclectic crowd to say the least .
when we stumbled on leon , we thought that we had found quite the gem but , we were certainly wrong .
head and shoulders above its neighboors on east 6 st , taj mahal is also very comparable , in food quality , to the much overpraised and underdeserving baluchi 's .
i had the salmon dish and while it was fine , for the price paid , i expected it to have some type of flavor .
the restaurant looks out over beautiful green lawns to the hudson river and the statue of liberty .
do n't eat here unless you 're starving for thai food and you work next door .
this tiny williamsburg spot is always pleasantly surprising .
i had the best ravioli ever .
while the menu is n't especially groundbreaking , everything i 've tried so far has been well-executed and tasty .
the food is great , service is ok .
by the time we were done , it was past 1 , 00 am .
when you 're sitting in their main dining room which has a spectacular , hand-painted high ceiling you 'd never know there was a world outside .
we visited bread bar during january restaurant week and were so pleased with the menu selections and service .
you could get a much better dining experience for the same amount of money in a lot of other french bistros .
the establishment scores big points in presentation and style .
they refuse to seat parties of 3 or more on weekends .
usually 3 vs 4 items per dish .
the waitress , seems to be more concerned of looking good than actually waitress .
what a ripoff !
there was a small wait , but shorter than i expected .
i 've lived in ny for 5 years and this place has it all .
otherwise , this place has great service and prices and a nice friendly atmosphere .
a + + the service was good to excellent along with the attitude .
black white shakes came out good also .
the seating was if they were trying to get the maximum amount of people into the restaurant , so be nice to your neighbor when you dine here .
however , they 've got the most amazing pastrami and the soups hit the spot .
great bagels made the old-fashioned way .
for the next hour and a half we stood in the crowded lobby area of this touristy restaurant listening to all types of explanations of why we were not being seated .
also good for client lunch meetings , esp .
the decor is dark , cool and soothing , while the food 's presentation is spectacular , considering the low prices .
the setting is casual and romantic .
it was horrible .
the italian food has flavor that can be sort of surprising on the ues , and the service turns from a nightmare to attentive , they sort of remind me of the ny yankees of the late 90 's , no matter how bad it look , you knew that there was a rally just around the corner .
mizu is home to creative and unique rolls not to found anywhere else .
the atmosphere is noisy and the waiters are literally walking around doing things as fast as they can .
i do n't usually order wine with indian so i ca n't comment on their wine list or their wine .
$ 200 for 2 glasses of champagne , not too expensive bottle of wine and 2 after dinner drinks .
the ambience was nice , but service was n't so great .
great people watching as others do the same to you .
maybe it was just an unintentional mistake but i 've experienced the same with other restaurants so i do n't appreciate such practice .
my friends and i have been going here regularly for two years .
the first time the sushi was outstanding , the second time it was a little bland .
all the food was hot tasty .
this is one great place to eat pizza more out but not a good place for take-out pizza .
this place was not all that !
others have to go to other restaurants and feel sad until they 're eaten .
the food is ok , but not any better than what you get at a good neighborhood restaurant .
the staff is no nonsense .
chinese desserts are known for healthful benefits in addition to the sweetness .
and really large portions .
the place is a lot of fun .
this is a great thai restaurant with a very friendly staff .
have eaten at ginger house several times , and it 's always good .
to give you an idea of how good we thought it was , we ended up going to ping 's three weekends in a row ! ! !
this place has many different styles of pizza and they are all amazing .
the photos of the restaurant in its web site are way better than the real look .
friendly staff that actually lets you enjoy your meal and the company you 're with .
when i 'm feeling stressed by the noise and congestion around my office , i head for cafe st bart 's .
guess the 555soul ads did n't launch her big modeling career .
this is my favorite italian restaurant in all of new york city .
the appetizing is excellent , just as good as zabars barney greengrass at a reasonable price if bought by the pound .
but , they were too big for the bun .
a few tips , skip the turnip cake , roast pork buns and egg custards .
a great choice at any cost and a great deal .
we 've only eaten in the restaurant once , but we have ordered many times for dinner .
the food is great and reasonably priced .
over the years the host , vittorio , and his crew , have always treated me as family -- although with all the business this not-so-little gem does , it amazing he 's even able to remember a consistent but not-so-frequent visitor .
the restuarant itself is not large , but seems to have several round tables to accomodate large groups hoping to save a buck to eat authentic taiwanese .
you can not go wrong with this place .
prices are in line .
the owner truly caters to all your needs .
my boyfriend and i went there to celebrate my birthday the other night and all i can say is that it was magnificent .
great romantic place for a date try to get the corner booth table for a little privacy and to sit close ! .
i asked for an open faced cheese sandwich and the manager basically told me to take my business elsewhere !
very good breads as well .
service is not exactly five star , but thats not really a big deal .
from beginning appetizers , the scallops were incredible , to the delicious chocolate souffle with rasberry mint sorbet , we were delighted by the taste sensations .
consistently good japanese tapas .
no apologies during restaurant week .
i went to this restaurant with a woman that i met recently .
planet thailand has always been a hit with me , i go there usually for the sushi , which is great , the thai food is excellent too .
i had to share my table with a loud group of kids and the service was rude an unattentive .
the food is usually good but it certainly is n't a relaxing place to go .
i 'm told that it is open 24 hrs which is good .
although , one night we went it was super cheesy , and another night it was less cheesy .
even though it is a little loud , you do n't have to yell at each other to talk .
it is kinda nosiy and the tables are close together but it 's still a beautiful place to enjoy a nice dinner .
was surprisingly disappointed .
i went to ruby foo 's after work with a group of 6 .
service was prompt , friendly and great .
the plain pizza was soggy and the creative wild mushroom ( third generation-fornini ) pizza we had was drenched with truffle oil in the middle again making it soggy and nothingon the rest .
after all that , they complained to me about the small tip .
behind this counter , two men are squeezed in .
the website and rating makes this place look wonderful but in reality it was very disappointing .
i definitely would n't go back .
it is not worth for that bucks .
oh , do n't even let me start with how expensive the bills were !
service is top notch .
you can also special order any kind of dumpling , etc .
i was at rao 's last wed .
i 've been to joya twice and i will never go again .
it is a lot of fun with live entertainment and all kinds of disney type special effects .
less = more in their case .
the dim sum servings here are a bit larger than i 'm used to .
we wo n't go to this place again for a good meal .
has the chef and owner changed ? ? ?
located at the end of a magnificent block .
hurley 's is terrific !
they do n't walk around with the trays of dim sum .
great bar , most gorgeous bar you 've ever seen specifically the blond lady .
really .
after 2 tries by the waiter to take it away we had n't even looked at it yet , we had full beers yet to drink , the manager approached and told us they needed the table for people with reservations .
my husband and i enjoy sangria .
in an area sadly lacking in decent thai food , this is one of the best spots .
other apetizers and food
i got the $ 10 10-piece dim sum combo , every bite of which was great .
there was a long wait for a table outside , but it was a little too hot in the sun anyway so our insde table was very nice .
i would definently recommend this restaurant .
if you like spicy food get the chicken vindaloo .
and its absolutely delicious .
definitely highly not recommended .
the two star chefs left quite some time ago to open their own place .
do n't waste money on decor .
friendly and informative staff , very attentive and prompt raw bar service .
fantastic !
all of it was simply amazing , unique and tasty and best of all it did n't break the bank .
delivery service is great too .
avoid this place !
the food is a diamond in rough - the food is delicious and homemade with the perfect balance of herbs and tomatoes .
it looked like shredded cheese partly done , still in strips .
nha trang , while being notorious for utter lack of comfort and decor , horribly slow wait staff and horribly quick meals , is one of the best vietnamese restaurants i 've ever been to the pho is delicious and comes with very fresh vegtables .
i live in the neighborhood and my friends meet me down here not only for the bar scene but also the promise of the pizza place at 3 am .
the portions are now very small , the sauces are overly-ambitious usually inedible while the service is still good , the restaurant , due to its popularity , seems frantic .
not only is the cuisine the best around , the service has always been attentive and charming .
any if you have a reservation you 'll wait for max 5 minutes , so have a drink at the bar .
whether it 's the parmesean porcini souffle or the lamb glazed with balsamic vinegar , you will surely be transported to northern italy with one bite .
while there are plenty of places to go for a good corned beef sandwich , katz 's has a charm about it .
however , looking at the table next to ours , we both sort of wished we had ordered pizza , which looked perrrrrrrrrfect .
i recommend ordering in on a weeknight .
while it 's not nobu , it sure is a great deal and you definitely will leave feeling satisfied and full .
they did n't disappoint , service from the second i arrived at the door was extremely pleasant and attentive with almost one server per table .
i would like to return and try some of the other menu items when i do n't have to rush off to a show .
go here .
$ 20 for all you can eat sushi can not be beaten .
warm and friendly in the winter and terrific outdoor seating in the warmer months .
i loved it and will be back soon .
this place , however , has a lot less pretension than joya and the thai food is still above-average .
we started with lox and mussels the best ive ever had , ever and had the cod and trout for dinner .
i did n't complain , i liked the atmosphere so much .
in reality to maximize potential diners they were still taking phone reservations and reallocating tables of those waiting in the lobby .
compared to other shabu restaurants around town , this places wins hands-down .
dinner took almost 4 hours without any lag time .
the problem is just that-it is a sometimes kind of affair .
made my dining experience uncomfortable .
we went to this restaurant based on prior internet comments .
the staff was the friendliest that have seen in new york .
during our meal , the management came over and checked on us and even bought us a round of drinks .
so , for good food i 'd recommend it , but not for a fun night out .
try the mediterranean salad , it is a true experience for your taste buds ! !
only wine and beer are served , but the house varities are actually quite good .
my mouth starts to water merely thinking about the delight that is this restaurant .
go with a group of friends and you will have a great time .
this lovely french-asian fusion restaurant stands out amongst other great restaurants on smith street .
the food was well prepared and the service impecable .
everything about this restaurant was special .
because we did n't have a reservation , we could only sit in the back garden , but it was great , secluded and perfect in nice weather .
it is expensive but well worth the money .
i wish they would change back to what it was before .
i 'm no food critic , but i 'd like to think i have a tiny bit of experience under my belt having lived in ny for the last 11 years .
the food was absolutely amazing ! !
i went here with my boyfriend and another couple .
the all you can eat deal is truly amazing here .
that is a problem since we paid about 20 bucks a dish , and had to order 5 dish to get a decent taste .
it is about food and ambiance , and imagine how dreadful it will be it we only had to listen to an idle engine .
the dining room is quietly elegant with no music to shout over - how refreshing !
everyone treats you like you were part of the family .
ive asked a cart attendant for a lotus leaf wrapped rice and she replied back rice and just walked away .
sea has become so popular that they 've let it go to their heads .
not worth it .
in the evening , this place attracted a well dressed , with it , ny crowd .
and forget what you read under me , the atmosphere is n't that bad either .
this was a great surprise .
although the place could be a little more eye catching and roomier , at the same time , it does n't really matter .
one of my favorite places in manhattan .
not worth the prices .
from the moment you enter till the moment you walk out the friendly and helpful staff was was just fantastic .
the quality of food at this restaurant accompanied by fantastic live jazz makes this place a perfect 10 !
patroon features a nice cigar bar and has great staff .
hey , i think $ 2 + for a 5 block walk ai n't bad .
i have never had cheescake like this .
i seriously doubt i will ever dine at jimmy 's bronx , or for that matter , jimmy 's uptown , again .
everyone i bring here always loves it .
my co-workers had to wait almost an hour for delivery , only to discover that what they got was not what they ordered .
a real dissapointment .
if you 're looking for a great meal at a decent price , go to del frisco 's !
i will be going back and heartily recommend it !
service was excellent , and the ac worked very well too thank god , it was hot ! .
my friend ordered some of their special sushi rolls which had excellent presentation and tasted great !
although be warned their dinner menu to sit and take out prices are different .
to celebrate a birthday , three of us went to mare anticipating great food .
i went to pams with my girlfriend , and i love it .
the spicy tuna roll was unusually good and the rock shrimp tempura was awesome , great appetizer to share !
a cool place to hang with your friends for a couple of healthy drinks and desserts .
the service is a bit slow , but harkens back to my years growing up in napoli , italy where things are not rushed and when you sit down for dinner the table is yours all night .
great food and the prices are very reasonable .
a cool bar with great food , and tons of excellent beer .
fresh , authentic , french cuisine in substantial portions .
drinks got screwed up , she acted put upon .
at 5 dumplings for $ 1 , you just can not go wrong .
and the staff is also young , energeic and hot ! ! ! !
we had a wonderful meal at naples 45 a month ago on a visit to nyc .
great food spinach and corn dumplings and massamman curry , very friendly and no nonsense service and a clean and funky bathroom .
romantic if you want it to be brightly lit .
i recommend it !
i have taken practically every guest that has come to visit me in ny and hooked a few new yorkers onto peep as well .
we did notice however , that some tables had what looked like pita instead of naan .
yeah , it 's that good .
my friends and i experienced amazing cheese and a delicious , new summer menu at artisanal last night .
love the jazz bands on fri and sat .
the service was ok .
the manager claimed that he could not compensate us for anything on the bill which just shows the lack of sophistication from the entire group .
it 's the only place you can get yummy authentic japanese comfort food .
this place is cool enough to be in the east village , but french enough to make you feel like you could be in a bistro in a back alley in paris .
after my 3rd time the manager remembered me and treated me like an usual customer .
you will find yourself returning quite often .
the prices were cheap compared to the quality of service and food .
the dim sum is delectable while the prices are quite easy on the wallet .
i ordered a chicken teriyaki dish and found that the chicken was extremely dry .
its located in greenewich village .
we would return to this place again !
i must say it 's a little pricey for the food because it was not as spectacular as the view .
no gimmicks here - the food speaks for itself in its freshness and preparation .
we were worried we would have trouble getting in , but somehow managed to have a short wait .
try everything for that matter , it is all good .
i 've been eating at taj mahal for over twenty years and have found them to be the most excellent of the indian eateries on this block of indian restaurants .
try the green curry ! ! !
you rarely have to wait for a seat and the currys ( masaman , green , red ) are full of flavor and come super spicy if you ask for it .
the bar is very well stocked with interesting beers and well priced wines .
i agree .
last memorial day , i tried to make reservations but was told they were closed that weekend interesting , but .
i think locals rate this place so high .
but they 've done a really nice job of offering all the typical pizzeria faves plus some terrific specials like the godmother pizza ( a sort of traditional flat pizza with an olive oil-brushed crust and less tomato sauce than usual ) .
go girls ! ! !
the one on the east side is much better than the one on the west side .
my gf and i still choose to eat there a lot because of diverse cocktails , the chill decor , and the decent sushi .
we ended the dinner with a surprisingly light and flaky apple tarte tatin .
the buffet had a nice selection .
waitstaff are very friendly .
service was efficient courteous .
i have been urged by friends for months to check out the mermaid inn .
toons has recently been redone , so it 's now a very attractive space .
we arrived for dinner expecting to be impressed by a place that has an impressive past , but , that 's just it - the past !
the wine list is extensive and impressive .
never fails to please .
make sure you have the spicy scallop roll .
this big draw is the all you can sushi here for $ 1995 ! .
the specials are usually quite good too .
they 've the best desserts and mixed drinks as well as snack foods .
the best burger i have had in the village .
i would have gotten some cole slaw and a knish if my stomach had more space .
there is usually a wait but it is well worth it .
your money could easily be better spent elsewhere anywhere .
as always we had a great glass of wine while we waited .
the wait staff is pleasant , fun , and for the most part gorgeous in the wonderful aesthetic beautification way , not in that she 's - way-cuter-than-me-that-b @ # $ * way .
for dinner i had the chicken tikka-masala and some garlic naan .
seriously , this place kicks ass .
the service was a bit slow , but they were very friendly .
leon is an east village gem , casual but hip , with well prepared basic french bistro fare , good specials , a warm and lively atmosphere .
nice place though .
similar to other indian restaurants , they use the dinner special to attract customers at the door .
the people with carts of food do n't understand you because they do n't speak english , their job is to give you the delicious food you point at .
drinks way over priced .
try it side by side and there 's no comparison .
so sorry i ca n't rate this better .
most importantly , food is excellent .
lloovve this place .
went last thursday .
one of the best chicken tikka masala .
service was also horrible and the ambience is not that great .
service is great , takeout is good too .
came looking for this place because i heard good things .
horrible .
the staff has always been attentive and kind , and i 've always been amazed at how they 've handled all the various different group sizes that come in .
great selection of wine , and seafood .
acceptable prices .
big thumbs up !
salads are a delicious way to begin the meal .
i ordered tamarind duck and my wife ordered noodles with ground beef , and we were both delighted by the way the dishes evoked thai flavors in unexpected ways .
that 's why you have to pay more for that .
and you ca n't beat the prices .
but i would n't wan na live there .
off the beaten path , this jewel of a restaurant shines just one block away from the plethora of 6th street indian restaurants .
this is definitely an excellent date spot because of the ambiance and on the weekends the night scene is more than alive .
the food was just ok , i would never go back .
got a little loud after 8 pm when the joint got full .
i recommend the thai popcorn ,
it is sometimes a little cramped , and can get a little warm , but hello , it 's nyc !
good crowd , good outdoor seating , with a hip japanese vibe .
even with the prix fixe pricing , this restaurant is not worth it .
good to find a restaurant where the owners have some imagination and they have actually pulled it off , like in this case .
the halibut was too salty , dessert was so so do n't waste any of your calories and service was poor .
the view is spectacular , and the food is great .
the food is wonderful , tasty and filling , and the service is professional and friendly .
we ordered the chicken casserole , but what we got were a few small pieces of chicken , all dark meat and on the bone .
and i have been around the block , to say the very least .
then , get ripped on free box wine .
the pizza is yummy and i like the atmoshpere .
the pesto pizza was excellent , thin-crust pizza with a nice amount of spicy italian cheese that i 'd never heard of before .
if your into thaiyou can not miss this great restaurant .
however , go for the ambience , and consider the food just a companion for a trip across the world !
food was good not great not worth the wait or another visit
obviously the chinese translation of this place does not mean big wong , it actually means great prosperity .
incredible food at a very agreable price brings me back just about every other day to this authentic thai restaurant .
i actually gave patroon another chance before writing this , but the second visit was even worse .
i 've been living in the columbia university area for about 10 years with 3 kids , now in their teens .
my wife and i will usually only order one primi and one secondi and split them , as they tend to offer large portions .
i have been coming here for years and have nothing but good things to say about the service and the great staff at la lanterna .
just bring someone who speaks cantonese because waiter may not understand you .
the bruschetta and panini 's are so yummy !
always popular , always full , always a wait .
in fact , you ca n't miss it .
it is run by the same sichuan chef who started the chain in chinatown .
get the feeling they settled into a groove a while ago .
if you are someone who appreciates the same things but hope to have food to spare or share , kai may not be the best option .
i do n't get it , what 's so special about prune ?
the first 2 courses were very good , but the chocolate sampler was too rich for me and the dessert wine far too sweet .
do yourself a favor and walk the extra avenue from joe 's to eat here .
it can not be the ambience , because the place is very cramped and some guests have to sit in an aisle .
we were disappointed with the pre-fixe menu of only 2 choices per course other restaurants offer 3 choices and ended up ordering a la carte .
we began with the cheese fondue the artisanal blend and added apples and kielbasa to dip .
the bread is the soft paratha bread unlike the plain bread they use in calcutta , and the stuffing is tandoori styled and very flavorful .
i love their thai noodles with shrimp and chicken and coconut juice is the must !
enjoy ! ! !
my boyfriend and i were in ny for a few days and pastis was a place that came recommended .
never again !
have the iced tea .
for park avenue i expected so much more .
you can actually get 2 salads worth if u take it home and add it to some lettuce !
they are fast .
the food is very good for it 's price , better than most fried dumplings i 've had .
everything is delicious , though , my gf and i come here once a week sometimes you will get addicted !
considering their price of $ 625 for lunch special , the dish was ridiculously small .
compared to ess-a , tal offers a less doughy bagel !
ballato 's is consistently delicious authentic italian food .
for those prices and the dressed up atmosphere you expect more and should get more .
highly recommended to all !
highly recommended .
unless you are eating in the pizzeria side of this place , and are not in a rush , this place is a bad idea .
after we got our sashimi order , i could not believe how small the portions were !
after the main course came , we did n't see our waiter for at least 40 minutes !
it will be on my to do list the next visit to nyc .
service is extraordinary , yet not overbearing , and the decor brings a taste of trendy soho into queens .
always fresh and delicious .
the food was very good , but not very thai .
thalia is a beautiful restaurant with beautiful people serving you , but the food does n't quite match up .
the portions are small but being that the food was so good makes up for that .
and it all comes at a very reasonable price congee , noodles , and rice dishes are no more than $ 3-6 each .
i had a great experience .
the chicken parm was edible but had canned tomato sauce and boxed pasta and the chicken with portobello mushrooms consisted of dry , inedible chicken with terrible sauce .
i recommend this place to everyone who asks me where to go for a good meal .
the only friendly staff member was the guy at the bar .
go for it !
i can not imagine a friendlier staff working in a restaurant .
the red curry is weak and tasteless , the pad thai is stuck together and lumpy , the rice is often overcooked , and the seafood is pretty sketchy .
the wine list is extensive and can easily hike up an otherwise reasonably priced meal .
saul is pretty good , but definitely not great .
we always get a sampling of appetizers and share .
big and soft as well as good lunch food .
by far the best salad i have had in a fast food restaurant .
their bagel are fine , but they are a little overcooked , and not really a special bagel experience .
no plans to return anytime soon .
i just do not understand what the fuss is all about .
we liked it so much , that we will always make it a point to dine here when we visit new york .
and you 're hungry a few hours later .
wonderful !
i have eaten a lot of pizza here .
i got an excellent piece of cheesecake and we had several other nice pastries .
so all i 'm trying to say is this restaurant is by far the best thai food restaurant i 've ever been to .
the duck confit is always amazing and the foie gras terrine with figs was out of this world .
wont come back again for sure !
the place is sleek , modern and playfull and i will return again frequently .
the owners and employees are friendly and their pizza is fantastic .
the food is yummy , especially their cooked-to-perfection mussels in spicy tomato sauce and their shoestring crispy fries .
the food is authentic italian , delicious !
a great addition to smith street , finally , a place that 's not pretentious and filled with women wearing ugg boots .
we spent $ 200 in this place and left hungry and very disappointed .
the service is good and ambience is good for a date or group outing .
it 's all about the food ! !
the decor is nice , but more casual than fine dining .
bravo , blue hill !
bottom line , b + for the food , f for the service .
my sister says it reminds her of a restaurant run by high-school students who do n't know what they are doing .
the only fallback on this restaurant is the prices .
i love the pics of andy warhol when he used to frequent the place he painted the ballato 's sign in the window .
i 'm saving up for my next visit .
amma is nothing special .
the atmosphere is much better than sripraphai more modern and sleek .
i had a late dinner at lucky stike , a great name for a joint if ever i saw one .
anyhow , we were able to sit as long as we wanted and chat , which was nice .
and they have these home made potato chips at the bar that are the most delicious things in the world !
my friends and i showed up on a sat .
the steak was excellent and one of the best i have had i tasted the butter intitally but in no way did it overwhelm the flavor of the meat .
great experience overall .
my husband and i have been there a couple of times and each time we sat at the sushi bar chef yoshi and ordered everything ala carte .
the vibe is very relaxed and cozy , service was great and the food was excellent !
it is what modern cuisine is all about .
at taj , vegetarians can rejoice-all the dishes are manna from heaven .
i 've never been disappointed .
from the street it looks very hidden , and is actually an old warehouse .
nice ambiance , nice little bar , good bar , francois , and good service .
in an effort to increase turnover , the restaurant offers no desserts beyond the complimentary espresso cup filled with chocolate mousse .
the food is spectacular , from the appitizers to the main course , and then of course the desserts , wow you 'll need no more .
the neighborhood was nice though so check out another restaurant instead .
they are still living in the dark ages and do not have an answering machine , so if you want to make a reservation you are limited .
ingredients are organic which is a real plus for me .
the staff was very attentive , the ambience lovely , and the food superb .
i love when restaurants think using fancy expensive ingrediants makes the food fine cuisine , even with no idea how to use them .
the service was superb , they treat you like family .
it only took about five or so minutes to get an empty table , but standing up was n't too bad .
too bad latin quarters closed .
for dessert we split chocolate cake and vanilla gelato with espresso , which were tasty , but i thought a bit overpriced .
we arrived on time for our reservation and seated promptlythe .
i plan on eating here more often .
i would definitely go back for a very special occasion , but not for regular fine dining .
i would never wait for a table to eat , it just is not that great .
the counter service is bad .
this is such a lovely , peaceful place to eat outside .
this is a great place to take out-of-towners , and perfect for watching the sunset .
since my first dinner i have had the chance to have brunch at orsay 3x .
they have some great entrees here as well .
our teenage kids love it , too .
the service is not consistently excellent - just decent .
the food , served in small tasting portions as an option is very good with each dish being better than the next .
they do cater to american palates , but if you like it hot let them know and they are more than willing to oblige !
i would just ask for no oil next time .
while this is a pretty place in that overly cute french way , the food was insultingly horrible .
i went there for lunch and it was not as good as i expected from the reviews i read .
i really did n't know what to expect for a restaurant that literally overlooks the main hall of grand central .
none of that yucky whipped stuff .
i would not recommend this place to anyone .
southern indian cuisine is still there , too .
of course the reason its so packed is because the food is so delicious !
the jukebox plays everything from italian opera to the strokes .
much of the time it seems like they do not care about you .
i 've eaten thai many times , and am very familiar with the cuisine .
i came into the city to try out this restaurant because a friend had recommended it to my husband .
all in all a wonderful experience , ca n't wait to come back .
there is actually space to breathe and the decor sets the tone for an intimate dinner .
we went around 9 , 30 on a friday and it had died down a bit by then so the service was great !
this place has realy fresh sushi and a nice large menu of japanese classic cuisine .
they 're also friendlier here , especially the owner , kenny .
this place is not worth the prices .
we left after one drink .
the last two times i ordered from here my food was soo spicy that i could barely eat it , and the spice took away from the flavor of the dish .
we figured we never had argentinian pizza before so we grabbed our lunch there , sharing a large pelligrino , a pizza of two of their specials , one was goat cheese the other blue cheese , and both were excellent .
heartland brewery is a great way to start or finish your day .
service was slow , but the people were friendly .
the steak was very fatty and the sauce was overpowering and not very tasty .
haru on park s is simply disgusting .
the staff was too busy ordering sushi for dinner and then laying it out to eat on the bar to even bring me my check .
the bagel was huge .
i like the somosas , chai , and the chole , but the dhosas and dhal were kinda dissapointing .
edible but really a ripoff at those prices given whats in the area .
i have been to casimir over 5 times and i have always had a great time there .
service friendly and attentive .
i can not recommend og more highly if i tried , check it out for yourself .
it was the first place we ate on our first trip to new york , and it will be the last place we stop as we head out of town on our next trip to new york .
save your money and do n't waste your calories , go to margharita 's on washington street instead , they have amazing food and the best service .
the service was attentive without being overbearing and each dish we tried was wonderful from the spring rolls to the cod with pineapple tempura .
it is not a place for tourists or someone who has never dined in bay ridge .
they never came back to refill our glasses again .
i would not have been so disappointed with the portions if the qualities were good enough to make up for it , but they were not !
there 's something smooth about sipping sake upper east side style .
going to volare is like going to your favorite aunt 's house for dinner , assuming that your aunt is a great italian cook .
the sushi has been from average to below average , the wait service has always been sub-par the atmosphere goes from nice to really irritating if you sit in the area beyond the kitchen , the acousitcs are horrid , everything echoes is extremely loud .
here you get the zen feel without feeling rigid .
everything a ny pizza joint should be .
we go often .
moral stay away .
when i saw that their website had a link to da ciro in napoli , i knew there was going to be good pizza !
the cafe itself was really nice with comfortable outdoor chairs and tables , but the service could have been better .
they outshine hh .
excellent lunch buffet for only $ 695 .
if you 're not familiar with the cuisine , you may encounter problems ordering here and be sure to bring plenty of cash with you as they do n't accept credit cards .
problem is nothing at prune is particularly memorable .
the service was great as well .
we were pleasantly surprised .
the food is definitely good , but i left a bit disappointed .
will give it another chance before i write it off .
this place is the most japanese it can ever get .
great food , lt 's of it , more then one person can eat !
the atmosphere is nothing special , but it feels like a sushi establishment in tokyo .
the ambience was so fun , and the prices were great , on top of the fact that the food was really tasty .
do not get the go go hamburgers , no matter what the reviews say .
if you live in upper manhattan , siam square is the place for thia food .
complimentary stuff kept coming , and when the waiter saw me opening a gift , i received my dessert on a plate that had happy birthday written on it , with a candlevery nice touch , and attentive staff .
if you are someone who appreciates simplicity , elegance , and wonderfully presented and tasting seafood and vegetables regardless of portion size , kai is your place .
i go back in line like three times on average until i ca n't walk anymore .
they treated us well and the food was extremely fresh and well-prepared .
we saw them heating up at least one frozen item though i 'm not sure which dim sum dish it was .
no you 're going to go back because the food was good .
the food was great and the service was even better .
while this can hardly be called a restaurant , it is possibly the best deal in manhatten , $ 4 for a plate heaped with rice and 2-3 entrees .
the fish is fresh and each piece is sliced to perfection and seasoned by the sushi chef usually with a little fresh wasabi and soy sauce but also sometimes with some sea salt .
very good wine choices .
they did give a 15 % discount at the end , was n't enough , as they knew the service was horrible .
the pizza was great .
kenny the owner is always there and he treats my family like we are part of his family .
delicious food , excellent service , and a pretty atmosphere make this a great choice for dinner and the $ 599 lunch buffet makes it an even better choice for lunch ! .
for appetizers , i recommend the shrimp fritters and dumplings .
honestly the worst sushi my husband and i had in our entire lives .
one of my favorites though was the angry lobster , a cold lobster salad that was magnificent .
the place 's decor and hidden bathrooms made for a good laugh .
its location is good and the fact that hutner college is near and their prices are very reasonable , makes students go back to suan again and again .
they treat me like family , morning and night .
service was on par but not wonderful .
i 'm just reading some of these reviews and its nonsense that people are reviewing some places because it was too loud .
maybe tomorrow ; -
i 've had the chicken with garlic sauce , chicken with black bean sauce , and hunan chicken .
because of the delicate thin crust , take-out pies get soggy in their boxes .
i do n't know about you guys , but when i go somewhere to eat i go for the food not for the atmosphere .
we 've lived in the area for more than 8 years .
i have to say that if this what makes it easier to get a saet a lunch i do n't mind .
my family and i ate here last night for our annual christmas dinner with the family members who would rather spend the holidays with friends out-of-town .
boy was i wrong !
ahhh .
it helps if you know what to order .
the service was typical short-order , dinner type .
the last time i walked by it looked pretty empty hmmm .
the combination of super-fresh ingredients in the dishes are unusual but really delicious .
i will be back !
rude service , medicore food are tons of restaurants in nystay away from this one .
being serious sushi lovers , we sat at the sushi bar to be closer to the action .
he served me an uni hand roll , which i never had before , and let me tell youit was heaven ! .
if you want to dine with large party , i recommend to make reservation basement .
i have reservations about the all you can eat deal , however - the choices are fairly limited and you can probably order more food than you can eat for less than $ 18 by just going off the menu .
the sushi is amazing ! ! !
for instance , plates were just dumped on the table , i was handed the wine list upside down , etc .
not one of our meals was edible , bland and/or made with weird rosemary or orange flavoring .
myagi is one of my favorite restaurants in the city ; the place the negative reviews describe sound like they were somewhere else .
we had lava cake we ordered when our food came it takes at least a 1/2 to make it .
when you add it all together , it just does n't seem worth it to meespecially considering the prices .
i was there on sat for my birthday and we had an excellent time .
not sure why this restaurant would be rated that highly .
the all-u-can-eat sushi is definitely in very poor quality .
it 's popular w/the late crowd .
why ?
while it is understandable that every place is indeed different , there was not a need to be uncourteous to customers and downright rude .
my friends settled for rice dishes , but we came back the following day to try the dim sum , which was goodnot outstanding , but good .
we waited at the bar and had martinis that were just right .
we were greeted promptly by the waiter who was very nice and cordial .
she was very helpful in suggesting us drinks and helped us in ordering a lot of good dishes since we knew nothing about indian food .
i lived in maine for ten years and grew up on fish .
while their kitchen food is delicious , their sushi is out of this world .
i expected quite a bit more from such an expensive menu .
my friend devoured her chicken and mashed potatos .
this is a nice pizza place with good selection of thin crust pizza including the basil slice .
i did not try the caviar but i tried their salmon and crab salad they are all good
you can get a completely delish martini in a glass that 's about 2-1/2 drinks for $ 850 i recommend the vanilla shanty , mmmm ! in a great homey setting with great music .
i love their thai
the restaurant has a family feel , not least with regard to the portions which are enormous ; the veal alone could have single-handedly solved third world famine .
guaranteed to be a tasty experience !
excellent spot for holiday get togethers with co-workers or friends that you have n't seen in a while .
simply some good tasting chinese food at incredible prices .
service is not what you are coming here for .
big wong is a great place to eat and fill your stomach .
yakitori ( bbq meats ) is tasty too .
was n't going to share but i feel obligatedwhile sitting at the sushi bar dining we watched the chef accidentally drop a piece of unagi on the floor and upon retrieving it from the floor proceed to use the piece in the delivery order he was preparing .
this place blew me awayby far my new favorite restaurant on the uppereast side .
the mussels were fantastic and so was the dessert going to be back very soon .
i 've also been amazed at all the new additions in the past few years , a new jazz bar , the most fantastic dining garden , the best thin crust pizzas , and now a lasagna menu which is to die for these are not your average lasagnas !
the pastas are incredible , the risottos particularly the sepia are fantastic and the braised rabbit is amazing .
it was totally overpriced fish and chips was about $ 15 .
but the best pork souvlaki i ever had is the main thing .
super yummy pizza !
i looove their eggplant pizza , as well as their pastas !
the space kind of feels like an alice in wonderland setting , without it trying to be that .
my wife and i went to water 's edge for a romantic dinner .
we had a very nice time .
excellent food for great prices
way below average
i love this place
the potato balls were not dry at all in fact it was buttery .
i 'll be back for sure .
worst place on smith street in brooklyn
went here on sat 1/26 and was disappointed .
red dragon roll , my favorite thing to eat , of any food group , hands down
just go to yamato and order the red dragon roll .
when i got there the place was packed but they made sure to seat me quickly .
the food was good , the place was clean and affordable .
the staff is very good .
food was ok .
i come here enjoy very much with husband .
great survice
quacamole at pacifico is yummy , as are the wings with chimmichuri .
best indian restaurant in the city
great food , amazing service , this place is a class act .
you want to have a real hot dog in brooklyn ?
it is so romantic .
its dark , and cozy there is always jazz music playing when we go .
once you try it for a special occasion beware you ca n't stop ! .
would not go back .
$ 170 down the toilet .
the dessert we had a pear torte was good , but , once again , the staff was unable to provide appropriate drink suggestions .
over all the looks of the place exceeds the actual meals .
this is the first place i 've been that a runner remembers my order hope he likes his job because i have half a mind to steal him for my restaurant .
the have a great cocktail with citrus vodka and lemon and lime juice and mint leaves that is to die for !
food took some time to prepare , all worth waiting for .
i never write on these sites but this restaurant is def worth commending !
when the bill came , nothing was comped , so i told the manager very politely that we were willing to pay for the wine , but i did n't think i should have to pay for food with a maggot in it .
i got hair in my food 2 times of then !
the food is flavorful , plentiful and reasonably priced .
it 's a great place to order from or sit-in .
good creative rolls !
indo chinese food , pretty good .
not a very fancy place but very good chinese style indian food .
i attended a holiday dinner at the restaurant , and the food was majorly disappointing .
rather than eating the meat entree being offered , i requested a vegetarian dish .
great food , great wine list , great service in a great neighborhood .
hands down the best pizza on the planet .
helpful service and average price per dish $ 10 .
the only thing that strikes you is the decor ? not very pleasant .
this place has great indian chinese food .
amazing my favorite ! ! !
the martinis are amazing and very fairly priced .
one of the best , if not the best , restaurants in park slope and ny in general
look , the appetizers were really good .
the entree was also very good .
ca n't argue about that , but they are clearly over priced .
just not good at all .
you would think they would make up for it with service , sadly , no .
i am actually offended to have spent so much money on such a bad experience .
we were ushered to the bar to wait momentarily and upon arrival were so excited .
since we were already waiting so long , we felt we had no other choice but to accept it .
for each course we waited over 1/2 hour to 45 minutes and were never offered a drink .
we also asked for hooka six times and the waiter kept telling us one minute and never returning with the hooka .
what we did do was waste 3 hours being trapped in a table waiting and waiting for food and drinks and hooka some of which we never received ! .
by the time we left our wallets were empy and so were our stomachs and we missed the show we were supposed to see following our dinner , which would have been acceptable if we got to enjoy the experience of good food and belly dancers !
do n't go with a larger group than 4 !
five of us walked in at approximately 6 , 20 on a thursday evening .
the hostess said wow that 's a large group , unless you are n't together , to which i replied no we are , and there will be one more , so a table for six please .
everyone seemed generally happy with their food , except my brother who had the grilled mahi mahi , seemingly drenched in grapfruit juice !
i heard the lobster roll was excellent .
great indian food
also , waiters try to push more food on you , like suggest things as if they are complimentary when they actually cost $ .
bukhara grill , the tagline says it all indian spice rave .
bukhara is on my top 5 indian places in nyc
fine , i wont hang you for that .
i completely recommend casa la femme for any special occasion and to really impress your date .
we ordered dosut bibimbap and nakgi-bokum .
the dishes came out around 5 minutes apart .
my wife had barely touched that mess of a dish .
if you ware looking for korean fusion , i suggest you try some of the places in the east village .
a quintessential slice of nyc pizza .
possibly the most romantic restaurant in the city
not only is it an adventure getting to this somewhat hidden spot , once you enter the unmarked wooden doors , the zen and intimate decor will make you feel like you 're no longer in the city .
we were 10 people celebrtating a birthday , we sat in the tent .
we never ate because by close to 2 in the monring we were not served and were too upset ad tired to start eating .
i tried a couple other dishes but was n't too impressed .
restaurant with a view
celebrated my fathers birthday here .
the food tasted very good .
this place is not inviting and the food is totally weird .
the concept of japanese tapas is newly created and clearly does n't work .
over all it was a very nice romantic place .
regardless , we 'll be back and ca n't wait to visit in the summer to take advantage of the patio .
the place has a nice fit-out , some attractive furnishings and , from what i could tell , a reasonable wine list i was given the food menu when i asked for the carte des vins
how is this palce still open ?
everything was going good until we got our meals .
i took one bite from the $ 24 salmon , and i have never , in the 17 years i have been going to restaurants tasted salmon as fishy , as dry , and as bland as the one in flatbush farms .
guess what , i waited for twenty minutes before she came over and when she finally did , she says , oh well , i wish you would have said something earlier no apology , nothing .
i was literally going to explode , but instead , my boyfriend took the bill and went to find the manager .
this staff should be fired .
i 'll being with a couple of positives , cool decor , good pita and hummus , and grilled octopus that was actually pretty tasty .
sometimes you pay a lot and do n't get much in return , it 's manhattan , things are expensive .
however , most of them are at least prompt and pleasant .
this place where do i begin .
only complaint is the pricing -- i believe it would be more reasonable to pay a dollar less on each item listed on the menu .
but nonetheless -- great spot , great food .
each time we 've been , the front of house staff not the waiters , they 're fantastic , but the people who greet and seat you has been so hideous to us that were it not for the exceptional fish dishes i would never return .
i 'd be horrified if my staff were turning away customers so early and so rudely !
a word to the wise , you ca n't dine here and disturb the maitre-d 's sense of table turnover , as whacked as it is , or else .
mussles and calamari were superb saturday evening .
everyone must come here at least once .
taking hot dogs to the next level
had an awful experience at casa la femme on a saturday dinner .
the pasta was well cooked , did n't have enough sauce though or flavor .
i though it was expensive and i prefer bella via just blocks away by far .
i went with jwils .
my friend is 100 % right in the experience we had .
the only thing that my friend left out is that when we sat down at the bar the bartender disappeared .
i asked for a menu and the same waitress looked at my like i was insane .
the design of the space is good .
