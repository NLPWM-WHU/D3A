sad very sad .
they were totally unconcerned that the computer was not correctly repaired in the first place .
that 's how frustrating it was .
i can barely use any usb devices because they will not stay connected properly .
- no backlit keyboard , but not an issue for me .
one suggestion i do have , is to not bother getting microsoft office for the mac expecting it will work just like you knew it to on a pc .
i shopped around before buying .
i also got the added bonus of a 30 " hd monitor , which really helps to extend my screen and keep my eyes fresh !
would do business again .
i tried to upgrade it to a newer version a couple of months ago and i still have the same problem .
i did have to replace the battery once , but that was only a couple months ago and it 's been working perfect ever since .
i love the operating system and the preloaded software .
after numerous attempts of trying including setting the clock in bios setup directly , i gave upi am a techie .
i honestly love my mac , thats why i am a self proclaimed mac addict .
i purchased this laptop while on a business trip to keep up with my email .
- they lost my laptop for a month
at first !
i think just going from pc to mac has gotten me totally spoiled and i ca n't imagine ever going back .
nightly my computer defrags itself and runs a virus scan .
i mainly use it for email , internet , and managing personal files pics , vids , etc .
the system it comes with does not work properly , so when trying to fix the problems with it it started not working at all .
if a website ever freezes which is rare , its really easy to force quit .
it does run a little warm but that is a negligible concern .
i always swore by pcs and would never consider a mac .
and if you have a iphone or ipod touch you can connect and download songs to it at high speed .
overall this laptop is great .
i continued to take the computer in again and they replaced the hard drive and mother board yet again .
ok , this is probably the best laptop series ever devised by apple .
i would recommend anyone to buy from pcconnection express .
and if you do a lot of writing , editing is a problem since there is no forward delete key .
enabling the battery timer is useless .
they had to replace the motherboard in april
also , if you need to talk to a representive at microsoft , there is a charge , which i believe is robbery , since you are charged enormous amounts for a very badly designed system , which most people would have went with xp if they could .
there is a little indent to help open it , but good luck with that .
it was a great deal after all .
yet , hp wo n't do anything about the problem .
this is what they told me , it heats up , and that is the reason we no longer call them laptops , and simply categorize them as portables .
this laptop is fast and you will literally learn all you can do with this dynamo by just watching the online tutorials .
it weighed like seven pounds or something like that .
2 months later , the battery went .
and it has blue screen crashed on me twice .
keys are all in weird places and is way too large for the way it is designed .
i 've owned every pro model apple laptop for the last 8 years , this is by far the worst one i 've ever had .
shiny this laptop is the best of the best !
i am however pleased that it is still hanging in there .
both my husband and i have this model toshiba .
i should have been more observant .
i wish the volume could be louder and the mouse did n't break after only a month .
1 payed $ 2200 for a premium laptop
the board has a bad connector with the power supply and shortly after warrenty expires the power supply will start having issues .
oh yeah , and if the fancy webcam breaks guess who you have to send it to to get it fixed ?
very fast and efficient !
after a little more than a year of owning my macbook pro , the monitor has completely died .
in my house , hp is a nasty word .
taking it back to best buy i found that a tiny plastic piece inside had broken manuf issue .
the amd turin processor seems to always perform so much better than intel .
only thing i would want to add to this is an internal bluray read/write drive .
i had static in the output , and i had to reduce the sound output quality to fm as opposed to the default cd .
it is easy to use and lightweight .
if you check you will find the same notebook with the above missing ports and a dual core amd or intel processor .
one of the primary reasons why i purchased an ipad was to store photographs so that i could show to my customers .
the gray color was a good choice .
i bought a protector for my key pad and it works great ,
it is easy to use , fast and has great graphics for the money .
i like how the mac os is so simple and easy to use .
it ca n't get any better .
the paint wears off easily due to the keyboard being farther back than usual .
i had purchased it from a major electronics store and took it to their service department to find out what the problem was .
on my powerbook g4 i would never use the trackpad i would use an external mouse because i did n't like the trackpad .
i think part of the problem with this computer is vista , yet i know vista is n't the entire issue because my latest purchase was my acer and it also has vista i should have waited the few months to get the next operating system .
the video chat is the only thing that is iffy about it but im sure once they unpdate the next version on the macbook book the quality of it will be better .
it is hard to fix and makes it a hassle to own one .
i use my mac all the time , i love the software , the way it takes a short time to load things , how easy it is to use and most of all how you do n't have to worry about viruses .
it was shooting sparks !
windows xp sp2 caused many problems on the computer , so i had to remove it .
this is my second one and the same problem , bad video card unreliable overall , this will be my second time returning this laptop back to best buy .
it runs perfectly .
if you have any creativity in you do yourself a favor and get a mac !
i recommend for word processing and internet users .
a longer battery life would have been great , but it meets it 's spec quite easily .
falls into the case .
mac computers automatically defrag each time you start your computer .
that is my only complaint !
this is likely due to poor grounding and isolation between the components , and i 'm hoping that it can be fixed with a ground loop isolator , but i still expected better product quality for this price range .
once open , the leading edge is razor sharp .
maximum sound is n't nearly as loud as it should be .
i have never had to shut down the computer unexpectedly and the computer has never froze on me .
great laptop for the price , works well with action pack games .
so what if the laptops/mobile phones look chic and cool ? the after sales support is terrible .
have not yet needed any customer support with this yet so to me that is a great thing , which is leaps and bounds ahead of pc in my opinion .
thinking about returning it
but it has a major design flaw .
it was heavy , bulky , and hard to carry because of the size .
it is super fast , and always loads .
this computer will last you at least 7 years , thats an amazing life spanned an electronic .
i bought mine from apple store the day it was released as amazon did n't have it yet .
three , the mac book has advantages over pcs with linux based os there is very few problems with system performance when it comes to a mac .
love it so far .
it is so much easier to use
it is so nice not to worry about that and the extra expense that comes along with the necessary virus protection on pc 's .
i wanted something that had a new intel core processors and hdmi port so that we could hook it up directly to our tv .
this has happened three times so far .
i 'm a professional consultant , and a client needed work on her machine .
compresses itself and you ca n't use it .
so , i must say i am not a happy camper .
it fires up in the morning in less than 30 seconds and i have never had any issues with it freezing .
it doesnt overheat or make any loud noises .
with a mac computer i have more free time as i do n't have to wait for windows to boot up or shut down and all the viruses associated with windows .
with all the goodies inside this machine , it is a value .
this computer had exactly the specifications i needed .
i had this computer for one month and had to send it in for repair .
not to mention , the battery life is absolutely amazing .
after about another month i had to send it in again to acer for repairs .
anyways i bought this two months ago and when i first brought it home it kept giving me a message about a vibration in the hard drive and it is putting it temporaly in save zone .
i worked in it retail sales before .
features like the font are very block-like and old school .
windows is also rather unsteady on its feet and is susceptible to many bugs .
then on top of it all their cusromer service center is in the middle east .
pretty much everything else about the computer is good it just stops working out of no were .
i asked how they would determine that since there are no scratches , dents or other signs of damage and was told that was the only way this type of damage could happen .
i did contact hp and share how unhappy i am .
pc never worked right even after bios fixed .
after having two pc laptops die with in the past 3 years , i was led to the apple display at best buy by the sleek design and promise of less tech issues .
the size is perfect and i do not recomend anything bigger except for any person who can exceed the limited space it gives you .
there are several programs for garageband pages , garageband , garageband , etc , music garageband , photo management photo booth , iphoto , video-editing or movie-making imovie , etc .
i am totally satisfied with my little toshie !
definitely recommended ! ! !
my opinion of sony has been dropping as fast as the stock market , given their horrible support , but this machine just caused another plunge .
the switchable graphic card is pretty sweet when you want gaming on the laptop .
i burned my leg , after lifting it from my desk , and for less than 5 second putting it on my lap to clean my coffee table , so i can place it there .
i have a lapdesk which i can use , but i can still feel the heat through the foam and plastic .
other thoughts , do not purchase this product .
and looks very sexyy , d really the mac book pro is the best laptop specially for students in college if you are not caring about price .
i took the computer back in yet again except this time they kept it to send into their geek squad headquarters .
they definitely have a superior product !
they are wonderful , but very dangerous when it comes to emitting heat .
the battery life is amazingly long at 7 hrs and 5 hrs if you use it .
me and my boyfriend bought the gateway nv78 in nov of 09 .
i am first time mac buyer and am amazed at features and ease of use the mac offers .
i definatly ca n't .
my laptop worked again for just a while before i started having issues again .
taking it back less than 24 hours of purchase
they ended up keeping my computer for almost 3 months !
i 'm still within the one year warranty but the repair " depot " has deemed that this time it was caused by physical abuse and is not covered .
wireless has not been a issue for me , like some others have meantioned .
this is my second mac book pro .
all the things you can do with the trackpad make navigating around the computer and its programs so much simpler , quicker , and easier .
i went right out and purchased another laptop .
went silently .
it is truly a desktop replacement .
in my opinion it was not as user friendly as i expected either .
they gave me a hard time yet again , but their was a malfunction in the battery itself , it did n't die .
it was definelty a smart move .
i 'm excited to learn more about what this powerful machine has to offer and encourage others to do the same .
sure hope best buy will replace it asap .
handles all my basic media needs easily .
excellent speed for processing data .
all in all , i 'm incredibly dissatisfied with this laptop , and with hp as a whole .
when you call tech support you were routed to someone who was in another country and did not know what they were doing .
before we got this laptop , had a compaq pasaro for 5 years with no problems .
i tried out another mac for a few months before buying this one and it is a great machine .
somehow the system clock got messed up after reboot .
the only problem is that i had to add 1 gb ram , the computer was kinda slow .
i visited the apple store and was impressed with the 17-inch macbook pro .
it works really well .
no big deal .
but see the macbook pro is different because it may have a huge price tag but it comes with the full software that you would actually need and most of it has free future updates .
before i bought my new i5 , i did my research for about 2 weeks and determined to move for hp to apple for reliability , dependable , and long lasting operations .
this has been nothing but a headache since we purchased it .
not super fancy , but not super expensive either .
great os , fabulous improvements to the existing line bumping up the processor speed and adding the thunderbolt port .
took that one home , same thing .
although its windows vista compared to windows xp sucks .
my mac has gone from being a trusted friend to an adversary .
one more tip , please purchase this model and get a 4gb stick of ram to save you $ 10
the computer runs very fast with no problems and the ilife software that comes with it iphoto , imovie , iweb , itunes , garageband is all very helpful as well .
it lasted for many years of travel , kids and abuse and if i fired it up today , it would work .
been a pc user for many , many years .
amazing machine .
i 'm very impressed .
has a 5-6 hour battery life .
my only issues are , 1 the screen/video resolution wo n't increase to a higher resolution then 1024 x 60
i run dreamweaver , final cut pro 7 , photoshop , safari , firefox , msn messenger and a few other applications constantly at the same time .
does a great job with video shot on a canon 5d mkii .
not to mention it has shit gigs .
i paid for extra memory and the 17-inch screen , as well as the top of the line dvd and cd burners .
quality display i love hp , , it 's the only computer/printer we will buy .
first it burned or fused the power adapter plug .
toshiba is aware of the issue but unless the extended warrenty is bought toshiba will do nothing about it .
- called headquarters again , they report that tft panel is broken , should be fixed by the end of the week week 3 .
the screen is framed by half to a full-inch margin that is obviously unnecessary , reduces the screen size and increases the bulk .
all the customers that come in hate dell .
we now own two of these , identical .
they 're easy , fun , powerful and will last a long time .
and plenty of storage with 250 gbthough i will upgrade this and the ram .
no temporary replacement , they are out of replacements because many computers had problems with the nvidia chipset status of repair .
programs would crash all the time , and it turned out to be a very unstable , unreliable laptop for me .
i find myself using the 10-key more than i thought i would .
best buy rocks !
the screen is bright and clear , the operating system is solid and friendly to a novice .
finally , the biggest problem has been tech support .
this is n't a big deal , i have n't noticed the issue with dvds or other media , only through usb output .
i had been a windows user before this i love the size because the screen is big enough for what i use it for internet , artwork , and yet it is small enough to be reasonably portable .
very good quality and well made .
i bought a logitech desktop set in anticipation for using with the mbp , but i use the touchpad 90 % of the time .
although i was promised about 10 hours , i found myself to a limited 7 hours which is still amazing .
probbly the worst decision we ever made !
this computer literally takes about five minutes to start up and to be able to use without it crawling and i do mean crawling .
it will be returned in the state to which it was shipped michigan .
i do not know for sure .
no machine has come remotely close to causing as many problems .
about 1/2 of the sites i need to visit because of my work contain some type of flash .
that was a big mistake .
the only problem is a lack of screen resolutions !
it is very well built .
we have n't had any problems with it at all .
returned it to walmart .
i love everything about it .
he said quite a number of people had encountered this problem and said it is a common issue .
not worth it one bit .
i just ca n't fathom that the celebrated dell would last a week in environment of free competition with normal products , it only survives b/c its substandard laptops are forced onto captive students and employees through question-raising programs .
support has been lackluster and now i just want a refund .
i hate to say this , but if i could take this back to the shop and get my money back , then i would .
> iphoto is probably the best program i have ever worked with , easy and convenient .
10 plus hours of battery .
its hard to encounter a problem on a mac that would require such abrupt action .
and the best part is that it even comes with a free printer when they have a certain promotion/offer going , of course !
the flaws are , this computer is not for computer gamers because of the os x .
i tried giving it 0 stars but i had to choose at least one , but imo no stars
it 's perfect for everything and runs faster than an average pc !
for being so small it is amazing that it is as fast as it is .
the machine itself is alright .
it seems to have some opions that are intalled but do not work like i thought they would .
i did an internet search and this is a very common problem with this laptop .
tons of bloatware and junk programs .
in summary , take your money elsewhere .
it is just slow slow slow .
the macbook is also made better , my computer has never got a virus , and the laptop runs just as fast as the first day i bought it .
i wiped nearly everything off of it , installed openoffice and firefox , and i am operating an incredibly efficient and useful machine for a great price .
overall i feel this netbook was poor quality , had poor performance , although it did have great battery life when it did work .
stupidly , mind-numbingly slow -- then i found it can only be loaded with 2gb * maximum * .
i can do pretty much 75 % of what i do on my desktop on my kitchen table .
being a pc user my whole life .
the real stand out on this computer is the feel of the keyboard and it 's speed .
love the stability of the mac software and operating system .
i left the place angrily .
asus said my net-book was working properly .
if you need an affordable , entry-level laptop , this will fit the bill .
i still have that stupid bluetooth mouse to !
screen is a bit glossy , but that 's not too bad .
processor , when compared to my 3 week old early 2011 edition there i barely experience any difference in performance 23 ghz v/s 24 ghz .
by air sounds more like by truck to me .
the speed gives you the power to work on these projects seamlessly , and multiple at a time if you sowish .
so i 'm disappointed in that because communicating with my relatives out of the area is a priority .
i have found it very easy to use , very imformative , wonder alerts and tutorials making it very easy for someone like me who is not exactly technologically advanced to learn to use the various features and programs .
i do n't have stupid pop up windows even when i have pop ups blocked , i do n't have to wait 5 minutes for a webpage to download , and best of all i can run all the web programming software i need to use all at once without slowing me down .
web access through the 3g network is so slow , it 's very frustrating and very disappointing .
moral of the story , - do not buy anything from companies that do not respect their customers .
not with apple .
if you want more information on macs i suggest going to applecom and heading towards the macbook page for more information on the applications .
so a couple of years later , i was a dumb college girl and had to have the wireless internet .
in my line of work , i often have to take work home , and this makes it so easy .
i use iphoto all the time , which is a great program for anyone who is into photography , amateurs and experts alike .
my macbook pro is no exception .
the only thing i wish is the 15 inch macbook pro has much better speakers on the side of the keyboard .
this is the first apple product that i have purchased .
now , as easy as it is to use , and i do think it is a great starter laptop .
this causes my wrist to scrape up against it .
it had some kind of pre installed software update that completely shut the computer down when you clicked it .
we were occasional mac users before , but most recently owned a budget pc since it is what we could afford .
the only thing i did n't learn in my research was the software i would need like privacy protection and warranty protection , in case it gets broken , or crashes etc .
i was tired of going without my laptop every few weeks .
just for a stupid cd .
i ' v spent as much for shipping as i would to buy a new netbook - of course a different brand .
this just keeps having it 's hard drive replaced !
right out of the box , this little netbook did everything i asked of it , including streaming the everyday video you 're bound to encounter checking mail and websites my biggest complaint previously .
what a mistake !
it discharges too quickly .
toshiba will not acknowledge this problem .
i 've have n't had any major problems with the laptop except that the plastic piece that covers the usb port wires have all come off .
it is speedy when connected wirelessly to any network regardless if the connection is weak or not .
connecting to my wireless router via built-in wireless took no time at all .
this computer is exceptionally thin for it 's screen size and processing power .
i have not had a problem with the applications quitting or freezing .
prior to this computer , i owned a powerbook g4 for 6 years quite a long time for a laptop .
this wiped out several programs that were installed on the computer when it was bought .
on the twelfth day that i had the notebook , i decided to go to dell 's website and update it .
it 's graphics are n't bad at all , for the lower end of the macbook pro spectrum , easily capable of running starcraft ii and other games with comparable graphics .
i have vista , so i am unable to install and unaspect2 some programs .
i do n't understand why i spent twice as much to get a laptop rather than a desktop when my lap top is completely immoble .
here we are another year later and the computer is doing the same thing .
despite the plethora of problems , i managed to use technological trickery to keep the machine operational for two years .
simply amazing computer ! !
whenever tried to turn it on , it would restart as soon as the bios launched windows or winblows , as i like ot call it .
finally was able to reach a young lady in california and ordered the machine and was subsequently given a delivery date .
i definitely will buy a mac again if and when this computer ever fails .
so if anyones looking to buy a computer or laptop you should stay far far away from any that have the name toshiba on it .
i 'm an excellent touch typist , and my hands are very sensitive , too .
the first full charge of this battery got me only about 2 full hours .
it is sleek , smooth , and lightweight .
i am a huge computer person i love anykind of computer that works well , but when i got this one i was so happy with the way it works and how it runs its amazing .
had to have this computer repaired twice in the first 5 months after purchasing it .
i could not find a phone number anywhere to call an actual live person for tech support and had to result the their online chat .
when i am next to my router on my hp i get full service , on my eee pc i get 3 bars .
this is what i call a good after sales service .
maybe it 's acer , maybe it 's msft .
at least those computers did n't just die on me like this one .
i had the bulk of problems with my lap top within the first six months .
very very slow laptop .
with what i paid for this computer it should have had everything on it .
apple is always great about the aesthetics of things , they always come up with good looking products .
honestly , i spent more time waiting for it to unfreeze then actually doing what i got on there for !
i have had at least eight toshiba laptops , and they have been outstanding , including this one .
what i 'd like is for the laptop to run well without having to purchase additional memory .
if you can afford a new laptop , and are in the market for one , of course , then definitely go for this .
got the computer back a month later and it was still broken sent it out again and they repaired it .
it works exactly like it did the day i took it out of the box .
there is nothing to complain about the system .
either the computer is too slow to detect the keys typed this is unlikely as i am a slow typist or the keyboard simply does not detect the keys being typed .
it 's fast , it 's easy easy easy to set up , easy to hook to my wireless network .
i made a perfect decision when i bought the toshiba !
it still heats up like mad and i am unable to use it with the computer directly on my lap for more than five to ten minutes at a time .
i did a lot of research and ended up thinking this toshiba was the best one for me .
i did not take the class and wish that i would have .
but the arm velcro is torn after one use .
not good for a person who gets online daily .
so it was only about 2 weeks ago .
i spent eight hundred dollars from a giant paper weight that looks good on a bus .
the program came with the computer and works beautifully .
acer wo n't replace the laptop .
charger seems large for this class of computer .
best buy ended up junking the computer and giving me a replacement computer .
i claim that this has no value to me , the laptop was new anyway .
enough said .
also , the battery does not last very long at all .
i bought it from hsn because it was bundled with extra software , but as it turns out , that software just crashes it more often .
unless you need the bluetooth 3 .
i was sorly disapointed to discover that hp what i thought was a reputable company would n't honor the warrenty when the fan blade fell apart .
it is everything that i would want in a computer .
however , if i sound enthusiastic about this , i am !
this system came loaded with windows 7 starter .
best thing is i can use existing 32 bit old programs .
mom , dad , brother , sister , you name it !
but it came back in even worse shape .
the only thing i would change about it is the mouse keys .
before , i reloaded with windows 7 ultimate and used only the downloaded drivers from acer 's site .
he loves it and it is easy to use and well the schools start teaching the kids early about computers so it was easy for him to get started .
also , macbooks come with much more features which are so cool !
now am very aprehensive about toshiba laptops .
the only downfall is the battery only last 15-20 hrs when not plugged in .
the graphics on this computer are also stellar , very clear and vivid .
i made the right decision .
in the past few years , i 've had terrible experiences with hp .
i occassionaly use it for work via vpn and it has not given me any problems .
will not buy another toshiba , this is my second , not happy w / either .
the cool thing about the mac book was that i went on my honeymoon and shot a bunch of pictures and movies with my iphone , then i came back and put them onto my macbook and made a pretty good dvd movie with all the pictures and videos from my trip .
now i had not tried to use this since the disc drive had been replaced and after taking it back to the geek squad i found out they had accidently not used the right drive when they replaced the first one , so back it went to get the correct drive .
first , you ll discover that the word processing program known as appleworks rarely translates perfectly on anyone else s computer , if it translates at all .
battery is not upgradable to a longer life battery .
in those three years , i 've had a couple of minor problems and both were resolved by apple quickly and easily .
it was secure and easy to navigate .
i am loyal to apple .
this was purchased for my daughter and i was pleasantly surprised .
i got the blue screen of death the first month i got it .
i had of course bought a 3 year warranty , so i sent it in to be replaced and almost 2 months later the dv4 is what the sent me as a replacement .
apparently there is a manufacturing defect , something with the amount of thermal paste .
despite the claims of the apple apologists a vice of which i am recently myself reformed the internals of mac laptops are no different from pcs at this point .
asus facial recognition does n't work and windows logon is n't either .
now when i order i did not go full scale for the webcam or full keyboard i wanted something for basics of being easy to carry when i use crutchs or wheelchair and with a backpack laptop bag .
i 'm new , just switched from years of pc frustration .
the display is beyond horrible .
i found this laptop on sale for under 6000 at best buy which was a great deal !
i love the easy to see screen , and it works well for work , persoal or just play .
awesome graphics !
i have had another mac , but it got slow due to an older operating system .
also the speakers are not very loud , but it is a netbook .
recently there are a few incidents that annoy the hell out of me .
i have been a pc user since middle school , but in my mid twenties i decided to convert to the dark side , or should i say the brighter side of life .
i ordered four d620 laptops .
i was psyched .
hp is more interested in selling extended warranties which cost more than the netbook new then they are in helping or fixing .
system is loosing about 20 % of performance because of that .
the hard drive crashed as well , and i had to buy a new power cord .
but enough about that , i am an apple convert for life .
another issue i have with it is the battery .
my macbook pro works like a dream , it has never overheated , or even been slightly warm for that matter .
pc users use the powerpoint program for slide-show presentation and mac users utilize keynote .
easy to carry , can be taken anywhere , can be hooked up to printers , headsets .
i can not even imaging going back to a pc after using this wonderful computer .
i fell in love with the hp pavillion and that was my replacement and now i could not imagine going back to an acer at all .
it turns out that this hp pc had been preciously sold by wal mart .
i should have bought one a long time ago .
just keep in mind the graphics is not dedicated so loading the movie almost took a minute , but it ran fairly smooth for a non-dedicated graphics card .
because it is a defective product .
second , it gets scratches easily and when it gets old some thing may operated
not easy to carry .
i considered i may have too much on the computer , but after looking , there was plenty of space and that is not the issue .
but then , something goes wrong .
this computer is good for 10 days then it sucks for the rest of your life .
this little netboook is helping me get work done !
i am a wife , mom and a school teacher and a college student .
to be honest i think it was faulty equipment or something but idk .
i also love the small , convenient size of my laptop , making it a perfect tool for my academic studies .
i love its solid build , light wt and excellent battery life for now .
i also bought one for my wife , and 3 for my office .
sound card is limited though .
after much battling with hp i was able to return it 4 times for repairs .
but let me tell you , the mac book pro is so professional .
go for it !
the mouse is a little bit different than what you 're used to though it has one big flat panel and one full bar instead of two separate ones to click with but you get used to it quite quickly .
it took several weeks just to get them to acknowledge that i owned the warranty .
- i propose that they can just swap the hard drives .
every driver on the driver dvd is everything you will need for a reload .
i know that asus is known for making motherboards , but this is the worst computer experience that i have ever had .
this is a great machine !
i can see why the have soooo much money .
and in 6 months , there have been no freezing up and no blue , purple , black or any other type of screen .
the improvements to the os have been relatively gradual , but substantive .
its been a year and am still waiting to see what there going to do about my laptop .
they discovered the manufacturer 's defect and sent it in for repair .
i had meant to purchase the nb205 and bought this one by accident long story .
exactly that , users .
some features arent friendly volume wheel , sound quality , etc .
- when i started worrying for not hearing anything from them , i tried to call .
adjust the sensitivity since it 's not that responsive to begin with .
as a computer science student in college , i find that the portability , longevity , and ease of use of this computer make me shockingly want to do homework more ;
so not having my laptop was discouraging .
fully charged , the macbook pro can last about five hours unplugged .
i especially appreciate the fact that it has almost zero viruses and spyware problems !
ca n't reinstall with standard os cd because of proprietary hardware drivers .
i have been very pleased with the performance of this laptop .
the great 18 month same as cash financing and advance protection plan which includes accidents like spills .
i was even able to uninstall mcaffe and install one of my symantec licenses with a no issues whatsoever .
this is still a fairly good upgrade to a laptop that was about 4 years old .
3dmark6 score is only 8500 .
so honestly , i was n't expecting anything less than perfection , and i was n't disappointed .
learning all of the keyboard shortcuts only took a few minutes to get used to as some of the shortcuts are the same on windows machines .
little short on ram but you get what you pay for .
it did n't come with any software installed outside of windows media , but for the price , i was very pleased with the condition and the overall product .
other installed features , such as certain printer software , are also most attractive .
i work in film editing and post production , so i need a laptop that not only has power , but memory and speed as well .
even doing so , the hinge may just be slightly tightened only .
i purchased two laptops for my husband and 16 year old daughter .
the ilife software that comes with the computer is so simple to use and produces a great finished product .
i am able to organize my pics , music and files easily .
the perfect notebook .
pros , the macbook pro notebook has a large battery life and you wont have to worry to charge your laptop every five hours or so .
i highly recommend this product !
so far , it 's an average laptop , no better , no worse than the hp i replaced .
i wanted to spend around $ 700 to $ 800 so i was directed to a nice looking hp laptop .
without a doubt , the * aspect0 * of this laptop is fantastic .
but the biggest pain is that tech support is not available 24/7 .
there are differences that you need to know and take time to learn .
i would say if you want to buy one of these machines be careful .
the laptop is outstanding in all aspects except that it has the windows 7 starter and not the full windows 7 .
i dual boot with linux and that other security-prone os and it performs flawlessly .
there was a little difficulty doing the migration as the firewire cable system ca n't be used with the ibook .
but other than that i am blown away by all the features this laptop offers .
i do find that my macbook has a lot more bells and whistles than a normal pc especially if you enjoy technology , downloading pictures and graphic design .
first the screen goes completely out .
i 'm learning the finger options for the mousepad that allow for quicker browsing of web pages .
i love this 13 mac white unibody .
we researched and found the best price at macconnection .
get this computer for portability and fast processing ! ! !
i 'm so glad i purchased a mac and not another pc ! ! !
few viruses to catch ;
i 'm tired of the inept service .
it still serves me well both in business and home needs .
the internet speed is spectacular .
if you shop around in the current market you can find a much better deal .
my husband uses it mostly for games , email and music .
my mac is much more efficient than a pc so it does not need the extra bells and whistles to compete .
you just lose a customer .
the computer will constantly be getting hot and burning your leg unless you go through the hassle of taking off the entire back of it just to clean out the fan .
did i mention everything about it , from size to weight to keyboard screams bulk ?
i really do n't like it , but i am stuck .
ease of use is just one of the benefits i love about my mac .
but , buy this model and just purchase 4gb of ram 2x2gb for $ 92 or 1x4gb for $ 99 , and save yourself $ 100 than the other model with 8gb of ram .
she told me flatly , it 's like that one .
i just got this laptop for college , and so far i am very happy with it .
quality display i was surprised with the performance and quality of this hp laptop .
its fast , has high definition quality in the videos .
i was wrong !
the ease of set up was terrific .
screen is crystal clear , yes it 's small , but it 's a netbook !
kind of annoying , but i still love the laptop .
hope this helped !
i used to build my own desktops from the component parts , and recently my 7 year old pentium 4 with ht 1 gb ram sata desktop stopped working this was a rock star 7 years ago .
this laptop serves all my needs .
i will not buy another one .
time will tell .
i have found a lot of online sources to help me but think that i would have learned a lot quicker if i would have taken the class .
you can even run a parallels type program easily and run any leftover pc software that you absolutely can not be without .
it has easy to use features and all the speed and power i could ask for .
i regret buying it before understanding how awful it is to use .
the final cut pro on this laptop is so fast and easy , and i can use this to seemlessly transfer all my work to my home computer , which is also a mac .
the computer runs extremely slowly , whether opening word or my computer .
i asked many people , search on the net and also read reviews here in best buy .
the screen is nice and the images comes very clear , the keyboard and the fit just feels right .
i have only had pcs with windows before so this takes a little getting use to .
but sitting on a lap or on a desk in front of you it looks more than big enough this could be because im used to my lenovo 10 tablet now plus this is a great size if i want to unplug the external keyboard , mouse , and monitor to take it with me when i take photos and video .
everything was so easy .
i do transcription work on the side , and the flatline keyboard makes typing quick and easy as well .
after 5 months of failed repairs , requested a full refund but was refused and it still is not repaired and acer is indifferent to the issue .
after years of using pcs , a new mac user is basically forced to re-learn how to use a computer .
you better believe my next computer will be a mac !
now that i have it i see that i really needed this for much more .
the internet explorer was very slow from the very beginning .
best buy laughed when i told them they should replace it instead of expecting me to be without a computer again for another couple of weeks .
the computer would not ever cut back on .
i would have to say that overall its great !
i use the computer to basically check emails , surf the web , print coupons and for my college papers .
* if you are looking for a good laptop , this is not it !
battery life could be better but overall for the price and toshiba 's reputation for laptops it 's great !
the windows 7 starter is , in my opinion , a great way to think about using your netbook , basics , basics , basics .
note that i do n't ordinarily take the time to write a review .
i purchased this netbook after my original toshiba laptop crashed right after the warranty expired .
buyer beware .
it has served my needs quite nicely for the most part .
after way too many times sending the thing in for repairs delivery service was slow , and without the laptop i had no access to the internet , and thus no way of tracking it to find out when i might hope to see my computer again , it finally kicked the bucket after just over 2 years .
enjoy your sitdown
the machine is slow to boot up and occasionally crashes completely .
this is great if you have several lectures back to back and do n't have a chance to charge during one of the lectures .
the screen brightness automatically adjusts .
either way i 'm furious .
the sata controller is the motherboard chip that lets the cpu talk to the hard drive .
i will never buy anything from hp again !
right size and weight for portability .
so far , so good !
i have had to call with a few questions or issues and they have helped me for free , even without the warranty .
it 's priced very reasonable and works very well right out of the box .
i would not recommend the purchase of this modle of toshiba computer or any toshiba product for that matter .
after they found no other way , they told me to courier it to themsince they do n't allow the use of the post office at my expense , and sent me a 4 page list of very specific packaging instructions to follow or it would n't be covered .
the mcbook pro notebook will make it easy for you to write and read your emails at blazing speeds .
the only thing i can say is that the touch pad doesnt work like it should all the time .
i am going to go back and return at store i bought from !
the difference is phenomenal .
problem fixed which is great but there went another two weeks without my laptop at school .
i bought this laptop the moment unibody product came to the market .
the only time i have restarted is during system updates .
the feel of this machine compared to the old macbook is far superior .
never any doubt i would get a macbook , just was n't sure which one .
the overall build quality of the unit is excellent and she 'd recommend it to anyone else looking for a netbook .
i guess he was the technical person .
i have the a65 , right now it 's a paperweight .
it is fast and i have not had a problem with internet connection or any other problems .
i 'm really impressed with the quality and performance for the price of the computer .
the lesson learned here is , it does not pay to by this loyal to any brand , since all of them are there to simply to make as much money as possible , as fast as they can , and in this day and age , the customer no longer is right all the times .
i saved for this laptop for 3 months and i can tell you personally it was worth the wait .
i have used different laptops in the past and i have to rate this one way above the rest .
i recommend the macbook pro if you want the best laptop on the market .
the applications are also very easy to find and maneuver , much easier than any other computer i have ever owned .
the large screen gives you the option to comfortably watch movies or tv shows on your computer instead of buying an additional tv for your dorm room .
the only thing that is n't perfect about this netbook is the speakers , they are not loud at all but i expected that .
if this is an improvement in customer service then i would hate too see what it was before !
will not every buy another -- -- -- -- lou
the 13 macbook pro just fits in my budget and with free shipping and no tax to ca this is the best price we can get for a great product .
i came from the dell laptops and now i am so glad i switched when i needed a new laptop .
better stick with another brand .
5 months dead again .
very happy .
the computer did what it was not supposed to do , and i did n't know what to do .
i tell everyone that i know , friends , family and enemies this is the absolute worst computer i have ever used .
you can call hp and they want you to buy more software to fix it .
it is easy to navigate and update programs .
i 'm making the switch and finding that my biggest problem is trying to do things the old way , and apple does , indeed , have the better idea .
hp did n't fix it .
applications respond immediately not like the tired ms applications .
the problems started with just the screen freezing .
taking it anywhere was a pain !
the screen is nice , side view angles are pretty good .
not to mention sometimes the whole charger unit will decide not to work entirely .
so i called , again .
anyway , in early july of this year , the dvd burner stopped working , and the computer stared having issues with power supply .
had some trouble finding a case that it would fit in .
my computer froze on several occasion , had buttons that randomely would fall off and even had moments when the computer would refuse to turn on at all .
not even safe mode boots .
this is an over-sized , 18-inch laptop .
2 blue screen first month
you ca n't even get a satellite card which is why i bought to begin with .
i use it now more than i even thought i would .
the most amazing part to me as a pc user is the startup and shutdown times , and the fact that you very rarely have to restart the thing .
long story , but after many calls to various offices , i was told that no one can override the depot and that managers do n't take phone calls or e/mails .
i can throw anything at it and i do , pictures , video editing , schoolwork .
price and purpose is awesome !
the two of us use it regularly .
worse , for the price i could get a * netbook * that outperforms this machine .
no luck , although i waited for hours on the phone-visited machouse , they stated the their call center is down due to too many phonecalls difficult to believe .
they had me send in the machine last april returned it to me in may with no documentation on what was done it anything .
all i can say is w-o-w .
he has replaced his hard drive twice and of course has had to pay for antivirus software every year .
i had the staff telling me older version did not make the fan noise cause it is a different computer .
was very much worth the price i paid .
even out of warranty !
a tip for people looking into this computer , do not buy it save up a bit more money and buy a computer that will last .
it 's a long and tirring process that after a while it seems like their game plan was to wear you out so you would want to give up on contacting them .
all apple associates are always wiling to help you out with anything , no matter when you purchased the computer and how many years passed .
i was waiting for this model to be released since january , and have been holding off on buying a macbook pro until the new model came out .
it started out getting hot after only a few months .
the toshiba satellite has been more than i expected for the price .
i had to adjust my mousepad sensitivity , because it is very sensitive .
to my mind much more usable than the toy called an ipad .
i also love having the extra calculator number set up on the keyboard which most laptops do not have .
with notes saying they replaced the hard drive .
from the start , when you open the box you see a completely different class of machine .
i setup my password last night with the password on my other computer .
it is an amazing image and it too is holding up quite nicely to little hands grabbing the back of my laptop .
we also use paralles so we can run virtual machines of windows xp professional , windows 7 home premium , windows server enterprise 2003 , and windows server 2008 enterprise .
i think i might rather suffer for something that is simple to fix in my opinion .
